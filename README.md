# Cryptocurrency Icons

[This project](http://cryptoicons.co) contains over 2000 icons ‚Äì [326 crypto, and fiat currencies](https://github.com/cjdowner/cryptocurrency-icons/blob/master/Coin%20List.md), in 4 styles and a range of sizes. Completely free. All I ask is that you don‚Äôt claim them as your own, and share this resource with others.

Images are in the PNG format (transparent) in 32√ó32, 64√ó64(@2x), and 128√ó128 variants, along with SVG versions.

If there is an altcoin you‚Äôre looking for that hasn‚Äôt been included, please create a new issue.
